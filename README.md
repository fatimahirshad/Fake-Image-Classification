#  Fake Image Classification

A deep learning project to detect **fake (deepfake/manipulated)** vs **real (original)** images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the [**FaceForensics++ C32**](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)

Includes a **Gradio web app** with a neon-themed UI and a **scanning effect** that simulates image analysis.

***

##  Features

* **Detects** **Deepfake**, **FaceSwap**, **Face2Face**, **Neural Textures**, and **Original** images.
* **Interactive Gradio app** with a vibrant neon design.
* **Prediction box** showing the top 3 results and their confidence scores.
* **Scanning animation** displayed while the image is being analyzed.
* **Example images** included in the repo for quick testing.

##  Dataset

This model was trained on the large-scale **FaceForensics++ (FF++) dataset**.

> **Note:** Due to size, the full dataset is **not included** in this repository.

ðŸ‘‰ [**FaceForensics++ C32 Frames (Cropped+Aligned)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatimahirshad/faceforensics-c32-frames-cropped-aligned)

***

##  Demo

Upload an image or test with included examples (`example_images/`).

The app will show a **scanning effect** and then return prediction results.

(Replace with actual screenshot of your app UI)

##  Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

The project is live on **Hugging Face Spaces** ðŸš€, allowing you to test the model directly in your browser without any installation.
